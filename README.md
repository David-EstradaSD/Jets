# _Jets Application_

### Overview
This application simulates a Jet fleet that the user can interact with. Initially, the airfield's populated by reading from a text file, but may be further manipulated through user input ( full _C.R.U.D._ functionality )

### Technologies
* Java
* OOP Principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism & Inheritance
* Collections ( _ArrayList_ )
* Conditionals & loops
* BufferedReader / FileReader
* Java's Scanner ( _user interaction_ )

### How to Run
You'll need a basic editor ( Eclipse, VS Code ) with installed extensions for JDK ( _Java_ ). Then Git Clone the source code into a file ( _usually done through your local terminal_ ). Open the saved file in your editor and access the Console tab ( _Eclipse_ ) or Terminal window ( _VS Code_ ) and run the application as a Java app. CRUD ( _Create / Read / Update / Delete_ ) functionality is performed by user input for menu selection through a keyboard.
###### tl;dr
Any IDE with JDK installed and a CLI

### Lessons Learned
One of my 1st projects, _Jets_ drilled-in key OOP concepts of Polymorphism and Inheritance; how they coexist and we cannot have the former without the latter. This app's very basic with _Scanner_, _BufferedReader_ and _FileReader_ but it emphasize's the fundamentals & significance of _collection_ (accessing data) and separation of concerns.
